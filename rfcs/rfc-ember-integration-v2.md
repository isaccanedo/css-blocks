# Request For Comments: Ember Integration for CSS Blocks v2.0

# Summary

The current ember-cli integration was built to make it possible for ember
applications to adopt css blocks so the application code would already be
written with css-blocks in mind while we followed up with a more robust
implementation that would meet all of the use cases well.

The time has come to take that next step towards making ember-cli integration
with CSS Blocks work great.

# Motivation

One of the challenges we've faced with making CSS Blocks work in an ember application is that addons are compiled independently and prior to the build for the main application. To make CSS Blocks work we bypassed the normal build system to hand css block files from addons to the main application and let the application compile them. This is problematic for a few reasons:

* Caching (especially persistent caches that live across processes) was basically impossible.
* Related to caching, broccoli trees are invalidated and rebuilt according to whether there's been any changes to their input trees. When trees have output that's not based on their input tree, it forces the plugin to opt out of intelligent rebuilds.
* As CSS Blocks ages and we have new releases, objects passed across the boundaries of package instances might be incompatible.
* Similarly, if some syntax is removed from css-blocks in a major version release that application would not be able to consume blocks built for an earlier major release.
* To prepare for embroider, CSS Blocks needs to be able to produce output that could work if that code was built in a precompilation of the addon prior to publishing. In that world, css-blocks should be only a dev dependency for addons.

# Goals

This project will be successful if it meets the following criteria:

* Stable, incremental builds that can do minimal work when block files or the
  templates that depend on them change.
* Have an architecture that is amenable to aggressive, persistent caching.
* Unblocks Embroider Support (Pre-built addons and engines).
* Global stylesheet optimization can be enabled.
* Has a clear, testable contract between addon output and application inputs, including support and test matrices for older instances of CSS Blocks code.
* Works well with addons that are using `yarn link` to develop in tandem with an application.
* Unblock the planned "Block Passing" capability.
* Both lazy and eager engines are working.
* Ember integration v1 remains functional and releasable from the trunk branch.

# Summary of Architectural Changes

1. Block Definition Files &mdash; This project will introduce the concept of a block definition file that, in conjunction with a compiled block stylesheet, allows the two files to be parsed into a Block instance. Like sourcemaps, these definition files can be a linked external file or inlined into the compiled css file as a comment.
2. Single-pass Block Template Analyzer & Rewriter &mdash; A single pass template analyzer and rewriter is made possible because of a novel approach to rewriting that allows us to late-bind the aspects of the rewrite that depend on optimization and knowing the whole state of the application.
3. Aggregate Rewriting &mdash; The rewrite information from both CSS Blocks and opticss is aggregated into a single data file that allows the optimization program that selects output classnames to run based on the runtime style state of the element that invoked it. By aggregating all rewrite information into one place, we can build a more optimal rewriter, enable block passing, and make possible the single pass template analyzer and rewriter.

# High-level Design

## Block Definition Files

Credit: This is a good idea borrowed from TypeScript.

A block definition file is a slimmed down version of a CSS Block. Most of the declarations are removed as well as any at-rules. Some additional information that isn't present in a normal block file is added.

When compiling a CSS Block we will be able to optionally produce a definition file. If a definition file is produced, the CSS file will be annotated with a magic comment that contains a reference to the block definition file.

If needed, like sourcemaps, the magic comment reference to the definition file can actually be the inlined content of the file. This facilitates use cases where passing around two files isn't feasible.

When loading a css file as a block, the magic comment is looked for and if found, triggers a different parsing mode that uses both files to reconstruct the Block.

## Single Pass Template Rewriting

In our current architecture we must analyze all templates and compile all the block files they consume, then optimize the CSS, and finally we rewrite the css and templates accordingly. These two passes, coupled with the need to have analyzed all the css and templates in the entire application and all addons before doing the template rewrite makes the CSS Blocks integration a poor fit with the design and expectations for how builds should work in ember-cli.

Additionally, although the ember-cli code currently runs build steps in a certain order, there's no guarantees regarding build order of say, stylesheets or templates (future releases of ember-cli might parallelize those steps; change the order; or as is the case for embroider, run some build steps at publish time instead of application build time).

To address these problems we will create a single-pass template rewriter.

This new rewriter will rewrite the template and as a side-effect, produce data that is later consumed to optimize the css classes used at runtime. The way this is accomplished is by making every element that uses css-blocks styles make a call to a helper that returns the runtime classnames.

The css blocks helper takes as input, the current styles being used and returns as output the runtime classnames.

The helper reads from a data structure that provides
efficient lookups of the runtime style information.

The contract of that css blocks helper will also enable block passing by making both the base block and the runtime block parameters to the helper.

## Aggregate Rewriting

The current approach to stylesheet optimization requires template rewriters that invoke a helper. That helper is a [virtual machine](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/blob/master/packages/%40css-blocks/runtime/src/index.ts#L37-L107) that takes as input the current state of possible "author-desired styles" as well as instructions for producing the optimized state.

In this new design, the instructions that run on the the virtual machine to produce output class names will no longer be co-located with the call to the helper. Instead, instructions to the virtual machine will be produced at the end of the build once all the templates and stylesheets have been processed. The helper will have access to those instructions and know which of them to run based on the inputs provided.

It should be noted here that production of runtime styles for a given set of CSS Block styles is produced using this optimization infrastructure even when opticss is disabled. This is how CSS Blocks handles concepts like style inheritance, style composition, and style aliases (all of which boil down to: "application of style A implies application of classnames X, Y, and Z")

# Detailed Design

## Detailed Design of Block Stylesheet Precompilation

### Compiled Block CSS format

The goal of the compiled Block CSS file format is to

A compiled block takes the following basic form:

```css
/*#css-blocks <block-id>*/
... compiled output ...
/*#blockDefinitionURL=pathToBlockDefinitionFile.block*/
/*#css-blocks end*/
```

There's three magic comments, let's walk through what they do:

* `/*#css-blocks <block-id>*/` &mdash; Indicates that the CSS that follows has been statically analyzed compiled by css-blocks. The block id must be 128 bytes or fewer.
* `/*#blockDefinitionURL=pathToBlockDefinitionFile.block*/` &mdash; relative path to a block definition file or an inline url containing a base64 encoded file contents. The form of an inline URL for a block definition file is `/*#blockDefinitionURL=data:text/css;charset=utf-8;base64,<encoded-data>*/`.
* `/*#css-blocks end*/` &mdash; marks the end of content compiled by css blocks.

Additionally, the compiled output file may have a magic comment for an associated sourcemap.

### Block Definition File

A block definition file is a legal CSS Blocks stylesheet for the block but all unnecessary rulesets and declarations and at-rules are removed.

The block definition file can be considered a serialization of the parsed Block's datamodel.

The block definition file differs from the source file in the following ways:

* `@block`, `@export` &mdash; The path to the block file is now the relative path to the file that the block was compiled to.
* `:scope` &mdash; The following are allowed only within the `:scope` selector:
    * A block-specific declaration of `block-id` with a quoted string value of the block's unique identifier (this id will match the block-id associated with the `css-blocks <block-id>` comment)
    * `inherited-styles` &mdash; This is a comma separated list of space separated tuples. The first value of each tuple is a style that is inherited from the base block but is not overridden. The second value of that tuple is the interface-index that style was assigned by this block. This allows the block to inherit from a block that is distributed separately and might have additive changes that affect the interface indices originally assigned to the base block. Precompiled blocks can't address interface styles that weren't present at publish time. This also allows us to detect and error if the base block publishes a new style that
    collides with a precompiled block's existing styles which weren't expecting to override a style.
* `resolve()` and `resolve-inherited()` declarations &mdash; The value of the block's declaration is now stored in the css file. In the definition file we replace this block's declaration's value with `resolve-self()` to indicate the relative precedence of that block.
* `@block-debug` at-rules are processed during compilation and removed.
* `block-class` &mdash; This block declaration is only valid in a definition file. Each block style will have the CSS class name to which it was compiled set explicitly. These names might differ from the names that would be generated by the options the current process is using.
* `block-interface-index` &mdash; This property is assigned a number that is unique within the current block's new styles (styles that do not extend a base block's styles). Style overrides are not assigned an interface index, because the value is inherited. The actual interface index
* `@block-syntax-version` - This at-rule is allowed in block declaration files to describe the syntax version of css blocks it uses. This version will be incremented when any syntax is deprecated. Codemods will transform old versions of the syntax into the current version before parsing it. In this way, our parser will not have to support more than the currently deprecated features and published code can be loaded without issuing unfixable deprecation warnings.

The block definition file may have a sourcemap with mappings back to the original source file.

### Miscellany

* `@block-debug <block> to comment;` &mdash; The output comment goes into the compiled stylesheet, it does not go into the block definition file.
* Provide a public API for getting a list of all files related to the compilation of the block file (inclusive of both block stylesheets files as well as all dependencies).

#### Example

Consider the following source file:

```css
@block link from "../shared/link.block.css";
@block list from "../shared/list.block.css";
@export item from "item.block.css";

:scope {
  block-alias: top-nav;
  block-name: nav;
  extends: list;
  display: flex;
}

.entry {
  block-alias: top-nav-entry;
  flex: 1;
}

.entry[active] {
  font-weight: resolve("link");
  font-weight: bold;
}

.entry:hover {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 1px;
}

@block-debug self to stderr;
```

It would compile to:

```css
/*#css-blocks 7d97e*/
.nav-7d97e {
  display: flex;
}
.nav-7d97e__entry {
  flex: 1;
}
.nav-7d97e__entry--active {
  font-weight: bold;
}
.nav-7d97e__entry--active.link-3c287 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
.nav-7d97e__entry:hover {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 1px;
}
/*#blockDefinitionURL=nav.block*/
/*#css-blocks end*/
```

And to the following definition file:

```css
@block-syntax-version 1;
@block link from "../shared/link.css";
@block list from "../shared/list.css";
@export item from "item.css";

:scope {
  block-id: "7d97e";
  block-class: nav-7d97e;
  block-interface-index: 0;
  block-alias: top-nav;
  block-name: nav;
  extends: list;
  inherited-styles: "list[type=ordered]" 1, "list[type=unordered]" 2, "list[type=inline]" 3, "list[type=horizontal]" 4, "list.item" 5, "list.item[last]" 6;
}

.entry {
  block-interface-index: 7;
  block-alias: top-nav-entry;
  block-class: nav-7d97e__entry;
}

.entry[active] {
  block-interface-index: 8;
  block-class: nav-7d97e__entry--active;
  font-weight: resolve("link");
  font-weight: resolve-self();
}
```

#### Parsing a Compiled Block

When parsing a stylesheet as a block, the file is first scanned for a magic `blockDefinitionURL` comment. If the URL is a data url, it is unencoded into the block definition file's content. If the url is a relative path, the definition file is loaded from that location. If the URL has a protocol or is absolute it is considered invalid.

The definition file is parsed as a block normally would be with the following differences:

* Before parsing, the definition file is scanned for a `@block-syntax-version` at rule and automatically upgraded to the current syntax using a codemod for each version bump.
* The `block-class` declaration will set the style's class name, overriding the class name it would normally be assigned given the current configuration. If not parsing a declaration file, this property would cause an error.
* The block's unique identifier is assigned from the `:scope` selector's `block-id` declaration, rather than being generated. If not parsing a declaration file, this property would cause an error.

Once the block definition file is parsed, the compiled output is parsed to load in the ruleset information for property conflict detection. The process for parsing these rulesets is the following:

For each selector in each rule:

  1. Find the key selector
  2. Find all the classnames in the key selector
  3. If there is more than one classname, it is a resolution selector: skip it because the definition file will have addressed that.
  4. If there is no classname, it is an error.
  5. Use the classname to reverse lookup the block style associated with it, if not found, it is an error.
  6. Add the ruleset (`RulesetContainer.addRuleset`) to that style.


## Detailed Design of Single Pass Template Rewriting

### Ember-CLI Integration

The current ember-cli integration will be re-written to be more in line with how ember-cli expects addons to work. In particular, we will no longer use shared memory to transfer css files and analysis information from addons to the main application which bypasses ember-cli's broccoli trees as the approved method of transferring files from addons to the main application.

By doing so and by building on top of existing broccoli plugins, CSS Blocks will get persistent caching and faster rebuilds, which are very important for large applications like voyager-web.

#### `@css-blocks/ember`

A new ember-addon named `@css-blocks/ember` will be created. This library will be a runtime dependency for any addon, engine or application that has stylesheets and templates built with CSS Blocks. When we support embroider, this addon will enable the precompilation of addons and engines at publish time.

Block stylesheets and templates are both compiled during the template processing phase
of an ember build target (could be an app, engine or addon). This is accomplished by
providing the following hooks:

1. `preprocessTree(type, tree)` - For `type` of `'css'`, the tree returned is a broccoli-funnel that filters out any css block stylesheets from the addon's CSS output. This is because blocks are compiled during template processing and their built output is placed in the tree containing compiled template.
2. `setupPreprocessorRegistry(type, registry)` - For `type` of `"template"`, we register our own template processor for handlebars and remove `ember-cli-htmlbars` from the addon. The broccoli plugin that we create will inherit from `ember-cli-htmlbars` and have access to the input and output trees as well as being able to inject our AST plugin that rewrites the template so that css-blocks syntax is removed and is replaced by helper function invocations for the value of the html class attribute. After template processing has occurred, our plugin will add compiled blocks and analysis data to the output tree. If a handlebars file is removed, the corresponding analysis data should be removed from the output tree. We also need to devise a way to safely remove compiled CSS Blocks from the output tree if they stop being used by the existing templates. (this is hard because several templates in the tree may use the css block but not all of them are compiled on each rebuild. perhaps the analysis data in the output tree can be of help to determine this situation?)

Note: Inheriting from `ember-cli-htmlbars` will require getting a patch accepted that makes part of that library's API public.

#### `@css-blocks/ember-app`

This ember-cli addon is responsible for bringing together the output from from `@css-blocks/ember` into a single location within the application, deduplicating files, running the optimizer, and ensuring the rewrite data is accessible to the runtime css-blocks helper.

This broccoli plugin will take as input two trees:

  1. The tree passed to `preprocessTree('js', tree)` which contains the application's build output for CSS Blocks from the `@css-blocks/ember` plugin.
  2. The tree returned from `app.addonTree()`. The addon tree is special because it contains a subdirectory named `addon-tree-output` where each subdirectory is the build results per addon.

This broccoli plugin will produce two files as output:

  1. `app/styles/css-blocks.css`
  2. `location/tbd/css-blocks-data.js`

Then this tree is filtered to remove the css file and merged with the `app.preprocessTree('js')` tree which is then returned as the tree for `app.preprocessTree('js')`.

This plugin's output tree is also filtered to remove the json file and merged with the tree for `app.preprocessTree('css', tree)`.

Note: wiring this up correctly requires ember-cli to guarantee that `app.preprocessTree('css', tree)` is always called after `app.preprocessTree('js', tree)`;

To produce the output files, this broccoli plugin will perform the following actions:

1. Find CSS files that contain `/*#css-blocks <block-id>*/` on the first line (because the block-id has a max length, we need only read the first 144 bytes of the file). If the magic comment is present and the block-id has not been encountered, read the whole file and it to the optimizer. If the block-id has been seen already, discard it. Don't transfer any files that were compiled from css-blocks to the output tree. (Note: We probably need to parse these compiled block files back into blocks, but we might be able to avoid it in the future.)
2. If the optimizer is enabled, find all the CSS files that are not from CSS Blocks and extract all the classnames with length 5 or less from them. These classes will be passed to OptiCSS via the `omitIdents` option to prevent them from being used by the optimizer.
2. Find all the serialized template analysis files, deserialize them and add them to the optimizer. Don't transfer the template analysis files to the output tree.
3. Run the optimizer and write the optimized stylesheet to a single CSS file in the application's styles directory (css-blocks.css). (Note: This file should be concatenated with the applications' other stylesheets. It should come after any resets and before any non-css-blocks styles.)
4. Produce the data file that the css-blocks runtime helper will use to rewrite styles for each element. We might need to inject this data file into a location that makes it appear as if it is in the same directory as the css-blocks helper. How to get this file to imported by the css-blocks helper without producing any warnings is something that we will have to discover through some experimentation.

Note: This approach means that blocks are parsed at least twice for each build. As an optimization, it's possible that we can find a way to share a block factory for each build/rebuild that will allow us to skip re-parsing the blocks, but we need to plan for the general case where the blocks come to use from cache or from having been precompiled in an embroider build. It's also possible that some addons will be built with different versions of `@css-blocks/ember` and cannot share a factory. In cases like these, the blocks will need to be restored from a compiled css block file.

### Design for Rewrite Helper Invocations

Consider an element `<div nav:scope nav:type={{@navType}} dropdown:class="trigger" dropdown:disabled={{@isNavDisabled}}>`. This element has two styles that are always applied (the two classes), a choice of one of several styles for the nav type, and one style that is conditionally applied. Ultimately these styles are transformed into css classnames. The rewrite helper takes as input which styles are applied and it returns css classnames that should be used.

The invocation of a helper is a list of arguments that specify which styles might be applied and provides the runtime values to determine which are currently applied.

The arguments take the following format:

`numBlocks` `[block definition]+` `numStyles` `[style definition]+` `numConditions` `[condition definition]*`

Where each of the named groups of arguments above is a set of arguments with
a predictable length.

* block definition: `sourceBlockId` `runtimeBlockId` - Where each block identifier is either a number or a string. If there's no runtime block swapped out for the sourceBlock, the `runtimeBlockId` is passed as `null`. Each block definition is assigned a local reference index starting with `0` and incrementing by `1` in order.
* style definition: `blockDefinition` `styleId` - Where `blockDefinition` is the reference index of a prior block definition. The `styleId` is a number that uniquely identifies that style within the source block of the block definition. Each style definition is assigned a local reference index starting with `0` and incrementing by `1` in order.
* condition definition: The first argument indicates what kind of condition. The type of a condition definition determines the length of the definition. The following types are allowed:
  * `1 styleDefinition` - A style that is always applied. The second argument is the index of the style definition that is always applied.
  * `2 styleDefinition subExpressionResult` - A style that can be toggled. The style at index given by `styleDefinition` is only applied if the value at `subExpressionResult` is considered "truthy".
  * `3 numValues subExpressionResult [value styleDefinition]+` - A style is selected from a map of value to styleDefinition reference. `numValues` is the number of pairs in the style map. `subExpressionResult` must be a string or `null` and if it's a string, that string must equal one of the values, when it does, the `styleDefinition` is applied to the element. If it's null, then no style is applied. If one of the values is null, then that style is applied when the sub expression result is null. If the value is non-null and doesn't match a value, an error is thrown.

Returning to our example above, the rewrite looks like this:

`<div class={{-css-blocks-classes 2 "nav" null "dropdown" null 6 0 0 0 9 0 10 0 11 1 4 1 7 4 1 0 1 4 2 5 @isNavDisabled 3 3 @navType "side" 1 "top" 2 "hamburger" 3}}>`

Let's break that down:

1. `2 "nav" null "dropdown" null` - There are two blocks. "nav" is block #0. It is not substituted. "dropdown" is block #1; it is not substituted.
2. `6 0 0 0 9 0 10 0 11 1 4 1 7` - The first number means there are `6` styles that might be applied.
    1. `0 0` - The `"nav"` block's `:scope` style has the id 0. This is style definition 0.
    2. `0 9` - The `"nav"` block's `:scope[type="side"]` style has the id 9. This is style definition 1.
    3. `0 10` - The `"nav"` block's `:scope[type="top"]` style has the id 10. This is style definition 2.
    4. `0 11` - The `"nav"` block's `:scope[type="hamburger"]` style has the id 11. This is style definition 3.
    5. `1 4` - The `"dropdown"` block's `.trigger` style has the id of 4. This is style definition 4.
    6. `1 7` - The `"dropdown"` block's `.trigger[disabled]` style has the id of 7. This is style definition 5.
3. `4 1 0 1 4 2 5 @isNavDisabled 3 3 @navType "side" 1 "top" 2 "hamburger" 3` - There are `4` conditions specified.
    1. `1 0` - The style definition `0` is always applied.
    2. `1 4` - The style definition `4` is always applied.
    3. `2 5 @isNavDisabled` - The style definition `5` is applied if the result of `@isNavDisabled` is truthy.
    4. `3 3 @navType "side" 1 "top" 2 "hamburger" 3`. The first `3` means his is a style selector. There are `3` values to select from. The value returned by `@navTap` is a string. If the value is `"side"` then style 1 is applied. If the value is `"top"` then style 2 is applied.If the value is `"hamburger"` then style 3 is applied.

Implementation Note:

* If, as you lookup styles on their respective blocks, you just push the styles onto an array, later the conditions will tell you what indices of that array are applied on the element.
* To lookup a block that's overridden, the metadata will need to contain a mapping from interface block's style ids to that concrete block's style ids.

Caveat: Although this helper will support block passing in its interface, no implementation of block passing will be built. If a non-null value is received in the current implementation, an error will be raised.

## Detailed Design for Aggregate Rewriting

Aggregate rewriting centralizes the data needed to rewrite all the styles in the application. At build time we prepare the CSS Blocks style relationships and optimization results to minimize the over-the-wire size of the data while also minimizing the runtime cost to calculate styles. As always, time and space is a balancing act, so this may require some tuning based on real world results. Additionally, the format of this data is designed to be amenable to being encoded as binary so that it can be much smaller than the textual representation of the same data. The initial implementation, however, will not us binary encoding.

An important aspect of this design is that the authored names for styles can be completely stripped from the build output so that only the optimized names are transferred to the client. Instead, each style is assigned a unique number.

### Overview of runtime style calculation

At runtime the CSS Blocks runtime helper is invoked and is passed information from the template that indicates which CSS Block styles the author would like to apply to the element.

Because of the relationships between CSS Block styles through block inheritance and style composition, the application of some styles implies that other styles should also be applied. So the first step of the runtime style calculation is to resolve the runtime state taking all of those style relationships into account. This resolution is also used to swap blocks at runtime based on a passed block parameter to a component.

Once the runtime state is resolved, the styles still fundamentally represent the CSS classes that were generated by CSS Blocks. CSS that has been processed by OptiCSS can take a very different shape. One class might become several and several classes may become one, and their names may be rewritten. OptiCSS returns back rewrite instructions to the consuming application that dictates how to convert to the optimized styles. Once this file is binary encoded, each rewrite instruction should only take a few bytes each.

Each source style implies zero or more optimizations. An optimization takes the form of an index into the list of concrete classnames as well as a boolean expression combining presence or absence of source styles. If there were no optimizations, it means the style only existed in the template and there was no CSS for it, therefore it was not optimized and can be safely dropped from the output. Otherwise, each optimization's boolean expression is evaluated and if true, the output class name is looked up as a string and will be returned back to the element to become the class list for the element.

### Data Schema

This is the annotated schema (expressed as typescript) for the JSON-compatible object that is generated during build and read at runtime in the browser to power the rewrite helper.

```ts
// Every CSS Block style is assigned a unique number that is globally unique
type GlobalStyleIndex = number;
// For clarity as to what type of information the strings are
type Classname = string;
type OptimizedClassname = string;
// this is a really fancy way to alias to `number`
type OutputClassnameIndex = Exclude<keyof AggregateRewriteData["outputClassnames"], string>;
// this is a really fancy way to alias to `number`
type GlobalBlockIndex = Exclude<keyof AggregateRewriteData["blocks"], string>;
// this is a really fancy way to alias to `number`
type OptimizationIndex = Exclude<keyof AggregateRewriteData["optimizations"], string>;

// These 5 lines are a compact AST for boolean expressions.
// Normally an AST would use objects with more expressive keys, but we want a
// more compact data structure in this AST for fewer bytes in our output.
// An array represents a sub-expression and the first element in that array indicates the
// sub-expression type.
//
// When a GlobalStyleIndex is encountered, that part of the boolean expression
// is considered true iff the current input state has that GlobalStyleIndex applied.
enum StyleExpressionType { AND = 1, OR = 2, NOT = 3 }
type StyleExpression = GlobalStyleIndex | AndStyleExpression | OrStyleExpression | NotStyleExpression;
type AndStyleExpression = [StyleExpressionType.AND, ...StyleExpression[]];
type OrStyleExpression = [StyleExpressionType.OR, ...StyleExpression[]];
type NotStyleExpression = [StyleExpressionType.NOT, StyleExpression];

interface AggregateRewriteData {
  // Maps a block's unique ID to an index of AggregateRewriteData["blocks"].
  blockIds: {
    [blockId: string]: GlobalBlockIndex;
  };
  blocks: Array<BlockInfo>;

  // This is a list of all the class names that might be returned by the rewrite helper
  // with the exception of public class names (block aliases) that are found in the styleImplications.
  // Note: classnames from the original source that are not optimized are also returned here.
  // Note: classnames from the original source that the optimizer has flagged as obsolete are not listed here.
  outputClassnames: Array<OptimizedClassname>;
  styleRequirements: {
    // The key is a GlobalStyleIndex.
    //
    // Value is an unordered set of GlobalStyleIndex values that must all be
    // applied to the element in order for the style to be applied.
    [styleIndex: number]: Array<GlobalStyleIndex>;
  };
  impliedStyles: {
    // The key is a GlobalStyleIndex
    //
    // Value is an unordered set.
    //   - GlobalStyleIndex: a style that is also applied in conjunction with the given style.
    //   - string: public class name (block alias) that is also applied in conjunction with the given style.
    //
    // Note: This list is only the directly implied styles. The full implication
    // graph is resolved at runtime.

  };

    [OutputClassnameIndex, StyleExpression]
  ];
  possibleOptimizations: {

    // Value is a list of all outputs that might apply for the given GlobalStyleIndex.
    [styleIndex: number]: Array<OptimizationIndex>;
  };
}

### Generating the aggregate rewrite data

* `StyleInterfaceIndex` &mdash; The indices assigned to a block's styles for its interface are owned by the block itself and are well known after the block is initially parsed. A readonly property will be added to the `Style` base class named `interfaceIndex`. When a block inherits from another block the base block's interface indices are preserved and have the same meaning in the sub-block. Any style that extends a base block's style, should not be assigned the same `interfaceIndex`. New styles should start their numbering after the base block's `maxInterfaceIndex`.
* `GlobalStyleIndex` &mdash These values are stored in a `Map<BlockClass | AttrValue, number>`. The only requirement is that there be no repeated values in this map. When a reference to a block style is needed, it can be looked up in this map.
* `blocks` &mdash; This is a list of `BlockInfo` objects.
* `blockIds` &mdash; This is a map from the block ID generated by each Block to the index of the block info stored within the `blocks` property. Block IDs are used during template rewriting to refer to a block because the block indices are not known at that time.
* `outputClassnames` &mdash; This list contains all the classnames that can be found in the CSS file that CSS Blocks will send to the browser. The first value of an entry in `optimizations` is an index into this array.
* `styleRequirements` &mdash; At the current time, this object will be populated for every `AttrValue` (a.k.a. state) to have a StyleExpression value that is just the global style index of the class to which that attribute belongs.
* `impliedStyles` &mdash; For each style, if has any composed styles, add their global style indices to this set (for compositions, composing a state also composes the class to which the state belongs). If the style inherits another style, add its global style index to this set. This only contains the direct relationships; do not include the transitive inheritance or compositions of these styles.
* `optimizations` &mdash; Each rewrite instruction returned from the optimizer is encoded here. Each instruction is a pair of values. The first value is an index into `outputClassnames`. The second value is a `StyleExpression` boolean condition that expresses whether the class name should be output based on the current set of styles applied in conjunction for the same element. While generating this list we analyze the conditional expression to find all the styles for which there is a positive correlation to the output class. Using those positive correlations, we use a `MultiMap` to track the possible optimization indices that the input style might trigger.
* `possibleOptimizations` &mdash; This object is serialization of `MultiMap` storing the possible optimizations discovered while generating the `optimizations`.
* `BlockInfo.styles` &mdash; See the description for `StyleInterfaceIndex` above.
* `BlockInfo.implementationStyles` &mdash; This is a lookup table that allows blocks to be passed at runtime. Every block that can be considered an implementation of a block gets an entry in the lookup table. This includes:
    * Any block that implements the given block's interface.
    * Any block that inherits from a block that implements the given block's interface.
    * Any block that inherits from the given block.

  The `implementationStyles` table only needs to be constructed for blocks that are declared to have a runtime parameter associated to it.

  The structure of the `implementationStyles` table is such that the interface index of a style is consistent for all the implementations, with the value stored at that location being the concrete style that implements that interfaces style. In the case of inheritance, styles that are not overridden just reference the concrete style in the base class that contains it. In the case of blocks that implement an interface without extending it, if there are styles that it doesn't implement, those get a value of `null` which implies no style is used in that case.

### Resolving runtime styles

There are four steps required to resolve the runtime styles of from CSS Blocks into optimized CSS classes:

1. **Evaluate Current Style** &mdash; Converts the helper invocation arguments into references to the element's current runtime styles.
2. **Concrete Block Resolution** &mdash; Resolves references to a block's style interface into the blocks that are specified at runtime.
3. **Resolving Implied Styles** and Style Requirements &mdash; Resolves the styles that are specified into the styles that are implied by the specified styles.
4. **Optimization Transformation** &mdash; Transforms styles from the styles specified by the input CSS into the styles emitted by OptiCSS.

#### Evaluate Current Style

The arguments to the helper are a stack of values. Once the stack is processed, the authored runtime style of the element is known.

The meaning of the helper invocation arguments is specified above in the section "Design for Rewrite Helper Invocations".

The first section uses block IDs to look up blocks and, if a runtime block is passed, get the concrete style view of the interface block. Once processed there is an array with length `numBlocks`, where each element is an array of GlobalStyleIndex values.

The style definitions are then processed by popping two values off the stack for each style definition. these are indexes into the two-dimensional array that we created in the previous paragraph. We accumulate these values into an array that represents possible styles that might apply to this element.

The remaining arguments specify the conditions that result in the styles being selected to be part of our current state. The description of the conditions above should be sufficient to properly determine the current styles from the stack.

It is recommended that we represent the current styles with a `Set` for the best performance.

#### Concrete Block Resolution

The first step of resolving a runtime style is to transform a style interface reference into a concrete style. When a block is not swapped at runtime, this causes the style interface to resolve to itself, but when a block is passed at runtime, the style interface is resolved to a concrete implementation using the styles stored at `blocks[interfaceBlockIndex].implementations[concreteBlockIndex]`. In that view, the indices for styles correspond to the concrete implementation by mapping to the same index as the styles are assigned in the interface block.

CSS Blocks has the ability to apply styles in conjunction with other styles using composition and inheritance. Some styles also have requirements that other styles are present in order for those styles to apply to the element (this is the case for states: they depend on the application of the class to which they belong).

#### Resolving Implied Styles and Style Requirements

At runtime, the implied styles and style requirements must be resolved before running those styles through the transformations generated by the optimizer. Please note that there exist situations where directly authored styles have requirements on the presence of style that is implied by a different style that was directly authored. There also exist situations where a style might be implied from more than one source. Because of this, there is not a simple way to check if a style with requirements should remain applied as there may be cascading effects to removing an applied style. The following algorithm is used to resolve style implications and requirements.

Given a set of styles that the author has applied, we create a directed acyclic graph that contains the styles implied by the author. We model the author as a "start node" that implies the application of several styles. Then for each style in that graph that has style requirements, we check if those styles required are in the graph. If unsatisfied, we remove that node, and all the edges to it. Then we prune out all nodes in the graph that are unreachable from the start node. We repeat this process of checking all nodes with requirements until no requirement check fails. All styles left in the graph are considered to be the current set of styles.

Note: It feels like it may be possible to transform the above algorithm into a single graph for the whole application and all possible runtime states of every element, thus allowing the runtime state to be trivially computed based on a single traversal of that graph. Because the size of our graphs for a single element will generally be quite small (usually `N < 5` and almost all with `N < 30`), my gut says that the space required to pre-compute a comprehensive graph and the time requirements to read from it would not be considered a "savings" compared to the algorithm described above. As such, I did not fully pursue that avenue of thought before discarding it; it's possible that I have done so in error and we might want to revisit that direction in a future release.

#### Optimization Transformation

Once the current styles are resolved, the optimizations can be applied. For each style in the set of current styles we use the `possibleOptimizations` map to create a `Set` of all possible optimizations for this set of inputs. The values of that set are indices into the array of optimization outputs at `optimizations`. Then for each optimization output, we create a `Set` of output class names for which the optimization criteria is met. The actual strings for the output classnames are then looked up by index in the `outputClassnames` array.

It should be noted that when the optimizer is disabled the CSS Blocks integration still populates `outputClassnames` with the source class names and populates `possibleOptimizations` and `optimizations` with identity transformations that cause the original style to emit it's own source class name.

## Open Questions

1. If a block inherits from a block and adds a substate to an existing state, should that state be reachable from a template that only holds a reference to the to the base block? It seems possible that the new substate value could be passed as an argument to the component thereby allowing the new substate to be selected. This proposed rewrite strategy prevents this from happening, but we could move substate selection to the rewrite helper, and that would make it possible for the new substate to be reachable. But... is it a good idea to allow it?
2. Does v2 need to interoperate with v1?

## How do we teach this?

This doesn't change the developer experience of working with CSS Blocks.

The installation instructions for getting started with css blocks will need to change.

Upgrading will require upgrading the application and the addons in unison, because we don't plan to be backwards compatible with the old implementation.
