This ember application is used to test CSS Blocks' [ember-cli
integration](../../../packages/@css-blocks/ember-cli).

This is a full application that you can interact with by running `yarn
start`.

You can run the integration tests to ensure things are working correctly by
running `yarn test`. These tests are ran in CI as well.
